# Simple Sales Data Visualization

This project provides a simple Python script to analyze and visualize sales data. It calculates and plots two key aspects of sales performance:

1. **Monthly Revenue Trend** - A line plot showing the total revenue for each month.
2. **Product Demand** - A bar plot displaying the total sales for each product.

The code uses basic Python data structures (`lists`, `defaultdict`) for data analysis and `matplotlib` for plotting.

---

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` (for plotting the data)

### Install Required Libraries

You can install the required library by running:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

---

## File Structure

- `sales_data_visualization.py`: Python script that calculates revenue, product sales, and generates plots.
  
---

## Code Overview

The script analyzes and visualizes the following data:

1. **Sales Data**: The data includes `Dates`, `Products`, `Sales`, and `Prices`.
2. **Revenue Calculation**: The revenue is calculated by multiplying `Sales` by `Price` for each record.
3. **Seasonal Trends**: The data is analyzed to see trends across months, where each monthâ€™s total revenue is aggregated.
4. **Product Demand**: The total sales for each product are aggregated.

### Key Components

- **Data Preparation**:
    - `dates`: A list of 365 dates for the year 2023 (January 1 to December 31).
    - `products`: A repeating list of products ("Product A", "Product B", "Product C").
    - `sales`: A list of sales data, each representing the sales of a specific product on a given day.
    - `prices`: The price of each product.

- **Data Analysis**:
    - `monthly_revenue`: A dictionary that stores the total revenue for each month.
    - `product_sales`: A dictionary that stores the total sales for each product.

- **Visualization**:
    - **Monthly Revenue Trend**: Line plot showing the total revenue for each month of the year.
    - **Product Demand**: Bar plot showing the total sales for each product.

### Code Flow

1. **Data Initialization**: The script creates sample data for sales.
2. **Revenue Calculation**: Revenue is computed by multiplying `sales[i] * prices[i]`.
3. **Aggregating Data**:
    - Monthly revenue is aggregated using a dictionary (`monthly_revenue`).
    - Product sales are aggregated using a dictionary (`product_sales`).
4. **Plotting**:
    - The script generates two plots: 
        - A line plot for the **Monthly Revenue Trend**.
        - A bar plot for **Product Demand** (total sales per product).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the `sales_data_visualization.py` file to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (if you haven't already) using the command:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

3. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python sales_data_visualization.py
```

The script will display two plots:
- **Monthly Revenue Trend**: A line plot showing the revenue trend for each month.
- **Product Demand**: A bar plot displaying the total sales for each product.

## Example Output

1. **Monthly Revenue Trend**:
   A line plot showing how the revenue changes across each of the 12 months in the year.

2. **Product Demand**:
   A bar plot showing total sales for each product (Product A, Product B, and Product C).
